## üîÆ Google Gemini Models

The latest Google Gemini model versions released in 2025 include **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash** with the following details:

| Model Name          | Exact Model ID                     | Release Date           | Context Window (Tokens)          | Main Capabilities                                                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro      | `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` (preview), GA expected June 26, 2025 | Preview launched April 4, 2025; GA June 26, 2025 | Not explicitly stated, but typical Gemini 2.5 Pro models support large context windows (likely 1M tokens or less) | Most powerful model with adaptive thinking, strong in coding, science, multimodal understanding, reasoning, creative writing, style, and structure. Supports multi-tool use, asynchronous function calls, and URL context. However, the June 2025 GA release showed some performance regressions in response quality, hallucination, and context retention[1][2][3][4][5]. |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash    | `gemini-2.5-flash` and `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025` | Flash preview May 20, 2025; latest update September 2025 | 1,048,576 tokens (text), 65,536 tokens (images, video, audio) | Optimized for price-performance, large-scale processing, low-latency, high volume tasks requiring thinking and agentic use cases. Supports text, images, video, and audio inputs with multimodal capabilities[2][6]. |

Additional notes:

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** preview versions were updated from `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` (deprecated June 19, 2025) to `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05` with improvements, but the GA release in June 2025 showed some regression in quality and factual accuracy[2][3][4][5][7][8].

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** is positioned as the best price-performance model for large-scale and agentic tasks, with extensive multimodal support and a very large context window of over 1 million tokens for text[6].

- Pricing for Gemini 2.5 Pro Batch API (launched in public preview April 4, 2025) is the same as real-time API, with no discounts for batch usage. Rate limits vary by usage tier and can be upgraded via AI Studio dashboard[1][9].

In summary, the **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (model ID `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05`) is the flagship model released in 2025 with advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities but has faced some quality regressions in mid-2025. The **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (`gemini-2.5-flash` and its preview versions) offers a large context window and is optimized for cost-effective, high-throughput multimodal tasks.
