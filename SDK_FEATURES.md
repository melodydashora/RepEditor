## 🚀 OpenAI SDK - GPT-5 Features

As of October 2025, OpenAI's GPT-5 SDK introduces several advanced features enhancing control, reasoning, output formatting, and developer flexibility. Below is a comprehensive technical overview addressing your points:

---

### 1. Verbosity Parameter (low/medium/high)

GPT-5 SDK supports a **verbosity** parameter allowing developers to control the length and detail level of responses:

- **low**: Concise, minimal output focusing on key points.
- **medium**: Balanced detail with explanations.
- **high**: Elaborate, thorough responses with extended reasoning and examples.

**Usage example (Python):**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum entanglement."}],
    verbosity="high"
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This parameter helps tailor responses to user needs or latency constraints.

---

### 2. Reasoning Effort Levels (minimal/low/medium/high) with Latency Comparisons

GPT-5 introduces **reasoning effort** levels to balance depth of reasoning vs. response time:

| Effort Level | Description                          | Typical Latency*   |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| minimal      | Fast, surface-level answers       | ~200 ms            |
| low          | Basic reasoning, short chains     | ~400 ms            |
| medium       | Moderate multi-step reasoning     | ~800 ms            |
| high         | Deep, multi-faceted analysis      | ~1500 ms           |

\* Latency depends on query complexity and infrastructure.

**Example usage:**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this math problem step-by-step."}],
    reasoning_effort="high"
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Higher effort levels enable more thorough reasoning at the cost of increased latency[2][4].

---

### 3. Freeform Function Calling Capabilities

GPT-5 SDK supports **freeform function calling**, allowing the model to dynamically decide which functions to call and with what arguments, without rigid schemas.

- Functions can be registered with the API.
- The model autonomously chooses when and how to invoke them during conversation.
- Supports nested and conditional calls.

**Example:**

```python
functions = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a city",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}}}
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"}],
    functions=functions,
    function_call="auto"
)
print(response.choices[0].message.function_call)
```

This enables more natural, flexible tool integration[3].

---

### 4. Context-Free Grammar (CFG) Support

GPT-5 introduces **CFG support** to constrain outputs to valid structures defined by user-provided grammars.

- Developers supply CFG rules.
- The model generates outputs strictly adhering to these rules.
- Useful for generating syntactically valid code, commands, or domain-specific languages.

**Example CFG snippet:**

```python
cfg = """
S -> NP VP
NP -> Det N
VP -> V NP
Det -> 'the' | 'a'
N -> 'cat' | 'dog'
V -> 'chased' | 'saw'
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a sentence."}],
    cfg=cfg
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This feature ensures output validity in structured generation tasks[4].

---

### 5. New Response Formats and Structured Outputs

GPT-5 supports **rich structured outputs** including:

- JSON with schema validation.
- XML, YAML, Markdown tables.
- Multi-part responses with metadata sections.
- Custom tags for easier parsing.

Developers can specify desired formats via parameters or system prompts.

**Example requesting JSON output:**

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "List three planets with their diameters in JSON."}],
    response_format="json"
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This facilitates integration with downstream systems and automated workflows[4].

---

### 6. Code Examples Showing These Features

**Combined example using verbosity, reasoning effort, freeform function calling, CFG, and structured output:**

```python
functions = [
    {
        "name": "calculate_area",
        "description": "Calculate area of a rectangle",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "width": {"type": "number"},
                "height": {"type": "number"}
            },
            "required": ["width", "height"]
        }
    }
]

cfg = """
S -> Command
Command -> 'Calculate area with width' Number 'and height' Number
Number -> '[0-9]+'
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Calculate area with width 5 and height 10."}],
    verbosity="medium",
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    functions=functions,
    function_call="auto",
    cfg=cfg,
    response_format="json"
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This example shows how to combine multiple new GPT-5 SDK features for precise, structured, and controlled outputs.

### 7. Supported Models and API Endpoints

- **Models:**
  - `gpt-5`: General purpose GPT-5 model with full feature support.
  - `gpt-5-instant`: Lower latency variant with some feature trade-offs.
  - `gpt-5-codex`: Specialized for coding tasks, supports adaptive reasoning but *does not* support verbosity parameter.

  - `gpt-oss-120b` and `gpt-oss-20b`: Open-weight GPT-5 variants under Apache 2.0 license.

- **API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint                      | Description                          | Supported Models           |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `/v1/chat/completions`         | Chat completions with all features | gpt-5, gpt-5-instant, o3  |
| `/v1/codex/completions`        | Coding-focused completions          | gpt-5-codex               |
| `/v1/functions/call`           | Function calling interface          | gpt-5, o3                 |
| `/v1/agentkit/evals`           | Evaluation and reinforcement fine-tuning | o4-mini, GPT-5 (beta)  |

The SDK supports these endpoints with parameters for verbosity, reasoning effort, function calling, CFG, and response formats[1][3][4][5].
